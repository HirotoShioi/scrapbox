# Diary

Today, I went to an `park`, with my _dog_ and found a **bone** under the tree.

## Code

Here is an example code in `javascript`

```
function () {
    alert (p.location.href)
    console.log("hello")
    // You can also write comments!
}
```

### Bullet Points

Here are list of things you can do in the **weekend**

- Sleep
- Talk an walk
- Listen to some musics
